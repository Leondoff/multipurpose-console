# MultipurposeConsole
## UbeydeWorkspaceCSharp
Ubeyde's Workspace (for C# Language)
First of all, hello everyone, I'm Ubeyde. 
I just started learning the C# language and I wrote these codes to reinforce what I've learned and gain practice. 
The code I wrote works fine and is open source, but has bugs.
You can send email to me for any suggestions: ubeydeozdmr@gmail.com
## 4 months later (2022 Edit)
In 2022, the repo formerly called "UbeydeWorkspaceCSharp" was renamed "MultipurposeConsole". Some changes have been made to the code. The project was rebuilt using .NET Core 6.0. (Previous project was .NET 5.0)
