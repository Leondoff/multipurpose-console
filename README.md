Ubeyde's Workspace (for C# Language)
First of all, hello everyone, I'm Ubeyde. 
I just started learning the C# language and I wrote these codes to reinforce what I've learned and gain practice. 
The code I wrote works fine and is open source, but has bugs.
You can send email to me for any suggestions: ubeydeozdmr@gmail.com
