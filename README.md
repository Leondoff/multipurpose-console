# MultipurposeConsole

## 2023 August update: After a long time

I had previously created this project to improve my very basic C# skills (not including OOP and some advanced concepts) and to learn programming language basics. I am archiving the repo as of 08.08.2023 as I do not continue development.

## 4 months later (2022 Edit)

In 2022, the repo formerly called "UbeydeWorkspaceCSharp" was renamed "MultipurposeConsole". Some changes have been made to the code. The project was rebuilt using .NET Core 6.0. (Previous project was .NET 5.0)

## UbeydeWorkspaceCSharp

Ubeyde's Workspace (for C# Language)
First of all, hello everyone, I'm Ubeyde. 
I just started learning the C# language and I wrote these codes to reinforce what I've learned and gain practice. 
The code I wrote works fine and is open source, but has bugs.
You can send email to me for any suggestions: ubeydeozdmr@gmail.com
